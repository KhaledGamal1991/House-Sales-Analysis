## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
XGBoost library should be installed which can be done by running "pip install xgboost" command on terminal.
Other than this there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I shall answer the following business questions using Ames Housing dataset:

1. What is the best sale time along the year in terms of price and opportunity to sell?
2. Which neighborhoods has the highest count of sold units?
3. What features affect the sale price and how can we predict it?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

I have added 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  it should be easy to navigate through the notebook  from loading the dataset till answering the above questions one by one.
I have also added comments and markdown cells to make it easier to navigate and understand the file.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found in the "Blog - House Sales Analysis.md" attached to this repo.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education, credit must be given to Dean.
You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
